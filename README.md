## Emoji Calculator App

This is a fully functioning Javascript based calculator that uses emojis instead of mathematical operators.

I built this originally to show my Javascript abilities to a potential employer, however I have added to my github incase it can serve as a base for somebody's project.

## How It Is Built

I used Laravel 9 as my backend framework of choice, and Vue.JS 3 for the frontend framework.

As for the look of the app, I used Bootstrap 5 to create the responsive look of the app.

## How To Install

Pull the project to your machine using your method of choice.

Run composer install

Run npm install

Serve the app using either Sail or Artisan Serve

Run npm run dev
